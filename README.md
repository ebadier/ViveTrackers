## Use HTC Vive Tracker devices in Unity3D with the following benefits
- Directly use OpenVR API for best performance
- Small library, easy to integrate in any projects
- A simulator, to develop without having a Vive tracking system connected
- Real-time pre-processing of tracking data to avoid noises in trajectories
- A complete test scene to understand the use of the library
- Some [documentation](Doc/ViveTrackersDocumentation.pdf) to setup Unity3D, SteamVR and Windows to get the best tracking quality from your Vive Trackers
